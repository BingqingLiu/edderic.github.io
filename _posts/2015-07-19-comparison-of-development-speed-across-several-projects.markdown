# Comparison of Development Speeds Across Several Backlogs

In this post I take advantage of [my
findings](/2015/07/12/probability-of-hitting-deadlines-based-on-pivotal-tracker-points.html)
in incorporating variability in time taken to finish stories based on their
complexity estimates (`1`-point vs `2`-points). I would like to see how
different backlogs at Lingraphica compare in terms of quickly getting `1`-point
and `2`-point stories done.

Just for reference, members of the Lingraphica Product Development team aimed
for a maximum of half-a-day for 1-pointer stories and a maximum of a full day
for 2-pointer stories. For more complex stories, they're usually broken down
into simpler stories. I would like to examine the stories that took longer than
estimated. Below I list the stories that took longer than expected so that we
as a team could, in the future, analyze what we could improve upon, so that we
could give better estimates.

Website Development is the most consistent in delivering 1-pointers under 4
hours (86.3%), followed by Product Development (73.4%), SGDs (70.7%), and
Therapy App Content (35.1%). I wonder why Therapy App Content is so much more
different than the rest.

I would say that our 1-pointer estimates for most of the time, with the
exception of our 1-pointers in Therapy App Content, are good estimates
as most of the time they are quite over 50%.

Developers in Product Development are the most consistent performers,
able to get 56.5% under 8 hours, although the performance is only a
little bit greater than half. SGDs follow next (48.9%), then Website
Development (45.5%), and finally, Therapy App Content (42.9%).

It's interesting here that only Product Development has been able to
go over 50%. Most are a little less than 50%. This could mean that
we are not breaking down stories enough into 1-pointers. It's also
possible that a lot of the things we encounter are just difficult
and a lot more complex than expected.

## Conclusion

I think we as a whole team could investigate how to improve 2-pointer
estimates so that they are more representative. Maybe we should start
incorporating points higher than 2-pointers so that most 2-pointers do
honor the under 8-hours of work that we strive for. However, that may
be easier said than done. It's very likely that there might be just
too many unforeseen complications in software development. In the process
of actually doing the stories, when we actually face the complexities
especially in our 2-pointer stories, it might be better to dynamically
split the stories further. This would probably solve the issue of the
2-pointers not being under 8 hours. By breaking down the story into smaller
ones when in the process of working, we can ensure that 2-pointers could stay
closer to the 8 hours deadline. The problem, with this approach, however is
that the estimate in the beginning, prior to actually doing the work, still is
an underestimate.

I don't have a perfect answer to solving this estimation
problem, but at least I've started gathering the data so that we could look
into the stories that actually took really long. Maybe there are patterns
in the data that are shared by these stories. Definitely something to look
up in the future.
